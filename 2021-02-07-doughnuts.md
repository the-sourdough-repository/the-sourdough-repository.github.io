# Doughnuts

Here I'll be making **Italian-style doughnuts**, also sometimes called **graffe**: a common feature of every bar and bakery, as well as traditional for
Carnival festivities, they are large, very soft and with just a sprinkle of sugar on the caramelized outside.

## Ingredients

For about 10 pieces:

- 230 gr strong flour
- 70 gr sourdough starter (30%)
- 75 gr potato, boiled in unsalted water, cooled down and mashed with a fork
- 1 egg
- 50 gr sugar
- 50 gr softened butter
- 90 gr milk (40%)
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 1 pinch of salt
- More sugar for covering
- Frying oil for deep frying

## Quick procedure

Fermentation at room temperature for 3-4 hours, then place in the fridge for 40 minutes to firm up.

Make shapes and proof them on a tray overnight, at room temperature, for 8-9 hours. Deep fry for a few minutes on each side, until golden brown, then toss them
into a bowl with sugar.

## Procedure

We have a dough that is low in water content, rich in fat, and with long leavening times.

Start by preparing the potato; while it cools down, you can prepare all the other ingredients. The butter must be left out of the fridge for 1-2 hours before
starting (depending on the temperature of your kitchen), to ensure it is soft enough.

When kneading the dough, I like to combine all the ingredients together, minus the butter. Once the dough is starting to come together, add the butter one small
cube at a time, making sure each cube is incorporated nicely before proceeding with the next. This also makes sure you develop enough gluten to facilitate the
following fermentation. The final dough should be very elastic, soft and slightly sticky. Ferment for 3-4 hours at room temperature, then place the dough in
the fridge for about 40 minutes to firm up a bit.

To shape, roll the dough 1-2cm thick with a rolling pin over a floured surface, then cut the external round shape with the rim of a large glass; for the hole, you can use a shot
glass, small espresso cup, or even the lid of a water bottle. If you want to add filling (such as jam), I prefer to make plain discs (with no holes); then I add
a teaspoon of filling at the center of a disc, wet the edges with some water, and press a second disc on top to close nicely.

For proofing, place the doughnuts on a tray lined with parchment paper. Leave the tray in a warm place (such as the switched off oven) overnight, for 8-9 hours.

When deep frying, first prepare a small bowl with some granulated sugar. Cut a square of paper around the doughnut, lift the paper with the
doughnut and place it in the frying oil. After a few seconds the paper starts to detach; grab one edge with two forks to slowly peel it off. This very nicely
avoids any concern about the doughnuts sticking around while proofing for such a long time. Each doughnut will need to be fried for a few minutes (5-8) until
well browned on the outside. Once removed from the frying pan, toss them still warm in the bowl with the sugar. Eat warm (do I really need to tell you that? :D).
