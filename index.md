## Welcome to the Sourdough Repository!

Welcome! I have created this Github repository and website in order to share my personal list of recipes with sourdough starter.

Why? After feeding a sourdough starter since spring of 2018, and, like many others, baking even more often than usual during various 2020 lockdowns, I realized I have grown a quite impressive body of good recipes and tips. I started wondering whether a giant, loosely organized Google Document was really the best place for all that information. Why not a simple website instead? I also like sharing particularly successful recipes with friends so having links to give them comes quite in handy.

As a result this is not a regular recipe blog. I might never post any pictures of the recipes (the jury is still out on that); even if I eventually do, I don't care much about the looks and presentation of what I prepare, so they would definitely look...artisanal, so to speak. I am most definitely not going to tell you the story of my life and of my entire ancestor tree for every recipe. Beside finding that trend boring, nobody else in my immediate family keeps a sourdough starter or bakes homemade bread regularly anyway.

Anyway, without further introduction: expect this page to grow a list of links to various recipes or other tips about sourdough. Happy baking!
