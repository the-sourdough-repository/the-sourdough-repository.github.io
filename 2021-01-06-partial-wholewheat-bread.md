# Partial wholewheat bread

As mentioned, this is a tweak on the 100% white sourdough bread described [here](2021-01-05-sourdough-bread.md).

## Ingredients

- 250 gr extra-coarse stoneground wholewheat flour (or any type of brown flour you'd like, including spelt).
- 550 gr strong white flour
- 600 gr water (75%)
- 280 gr sourdough starter (35%); can be lowered to 250 gr if preferred.
- 16 gr salt (2%)

## Quick procedure

Fermentation: 4.5h-5h, with 3 sets of folds 20 minutes apart for the first hour. Shaping, then proofing overnight in the fridge for 8-9 hours.
Baking at 240 degrees with steam for 20 minutes, then 210 degrees without steam for 30 minutes.

## Procedure

The basic procedure is the same as I described for the 100% white sourdough bread, with some changes I'll describe below.

Since this bread has wholewheat flour, which tends to make bread more dense, I find that increasing the water content improves the result. To keep the dough
easy to handle and shape by hand, I make the following changes:

- I do an **autolyse** step in advance; I mix all the flours and water together in a bowl (no kneading required here) and then let them sit on the counter for
  1-2 hours;
- As soon as the fermentation starts, I do 3 sets of coil folds spaced 20 minutes apart.

You can use other types of folds such as stretch&fold if you'd like, but I find that coil folds work really well. Be sure to wet your hands to avoid too much
stickiness, especially during the first fold.

Overall fermentation times might need to be adjusted upward due to the presence of wholewheat flour, but not excessively (usually, 4.30-5h instead of 4h). I
still do the overnight proof in the fridge, and the baking process is also unchanged.
