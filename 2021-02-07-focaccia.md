# Focaccia

Focaccia is in my opinion the easiest bread in the world: straightforward and quick fermentation, and no-fuss baking process. If you are a total beginner,
this is where you can start!

## Ingredients

For one large baking sheet:

- 700 gr bread flour
- 170 gr sourdough starter (24%)
- 13 gr salt (2%)
- 450 gr water (64%)
- 40 gr olive or other vegetable oil (6 heaping tablespoons)
- 2 small teaspoons sugar (optional)
- Olive oil, coarse salt and rosemary for seasoning

## Quick procedure

Bulk fermentation: 3-4 hours at room temperature.
If you prefer overnight bulk fermentation: 1.5h room temperature + overnight in the fridge + 2h bring back to room temperature.

Shape on an oiled sheet and add the seasoning; second proofing 1.5-2 hours.

Bake 200 degrees for 25-30 minutes. No steaming required.

## Procedure

There isn't much more to say compared to the quick version; a few notes below:

When **shaping** on the baking sheet (or dish) make sure the dough has more or less the same level of thickness all over, or you'll get some airy soft parts
and some thin crunchy parts. Feel free to leave a few gaps around the corners, as the dough will fill them out very easily. If shaping a single large focaccia
is too cumbersome, divide it into 2-3 smaller pieces, arrange them on the sheet, and then shape them individually.
  
When adding the **seasoning**, sprinkle olive oil and work it around the surface of the dough by pressing gently with your fingers. Then add all the others; the
classical combination is fresh rosemary and coarse salt grains. I add them before the proofing stage so the rise will incorporate them a bit and they will not
slide away too much. However if you are planning to use a proofing oven to create a warm environment, keep in mind that salt flakes might melt and you will
lose the crunch; in that case, add them at the very end. Before baking lots of people also spread a bit more oil (yes, more oil! :D).

Larger toppings such as cheese pieces, olives or sundried tomatoes should be added to the dough before the first fermentation.
