# Simple brioche

A simple sweet brioche, with a relatively low fat content, which is why it was sometimes called "poor man's brioche". Don't worry, it is not as depressing as
it sounds.

## Ingredients

Fills 1 medium-sized round cake tin:

- 300 gr strong flour
- 200 gr plain all-purpose flour
- 140 gr sourdough starter (28%)
- 250 ml milk (50%)
- 1 egg
- 50 gr butter
- 5 gr salt (1%)
- 50 gr sugar (10%); this can be adjusted to any value between 30 and 60 grams, depending on how sweet you like it.

1% salt might not sound like an important ingredient, but it does add a bit of depth to the overall flavour. As you might notice, savoury breads are pretty
much fixed to 2% salt, while sweet ones tend to go with 1-1.5%.

## Quick procedure

Bulk fermentation overnight at room temperature (8-10 hours).

Arrange in the desired shape (loaf, rolls...) and proof for 1-2 hours.

Bake at 180 degrees for 30 minutes until browned on the surface.

## Procedure

The egg, milk and butter should be at room temperature, so take them out of the fridge 1-2 hours prior to starting.

When **kneading** the dough, I like to combine all the ingredients together, minus the butter. Once the dough is starting to come together, add the butter
one small cube at a time, making sure each cube is incorporated nicely before proceeding with the next. This also makes sure you develop enough gluten
to facilitate the following fermentation. The final dough should be very elastic, soft and slightly sticky.

**Bulk ferment** overnight at room temperature. Note: depending on how warm your kitchen is, this can lead the dough to overferment a bit. If your environment
is very warm try to reduce to around 7 hours. If overfermentation occurs, don't worry, you can still continue with the recipe but you will need to add a bit
more flour to make the dough come together again. Also, the final product will have a stronger sour aftertaste, but personally I like that.

Now for the shape. For rolls, make around 10 of them, roll them up tight to firm the surface up, then arrange them in a buttered and floured tin. For a single
loaf you can shape it as a normal loaf of bread. Cover and proof at room temperature for 1-2 hours, or until the dough has reached the edge of the tin and has
filled up any remaining space.

Prior to baking, you can cover the surface with some egg wash. Bake at 180 degrees static for 30 minutes until well golden on the surface. Once removed from the
oven you can spread some honey on top for an extra glaze.
